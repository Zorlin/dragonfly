## Dragonfly Server Deployment

### Overview

This document outlines the core user flows and behaviors for Dragonfly across various scenarios. It defines how Dragonfly behaves when executed from the CLI or server context, what installation looks like, and how the onboarding experience adapts based on state. It also describes the different operating modes available to the user post-install.

---

### üß™ Scenario A: CLI Invocation (e.g., `dragonfly`)

#### Default behavior:

When a user runs `dragonfly` from the command line:

#### If Dragonfly is already installed:

- Ensure all Dragonfly services are running.
- Print the local address of the WebUI (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).
- Print the full CLI help text.

#### If Dragonfly is not installed:

- Print the CLI help text.
- Do **not** attempt to inspect any server state.
- Emphasize that `dragonfly install` is the next step.

---

### üñ•Ô∏è Scenario B: Server Mode (`dragonfly server`)

#### If Dragonfly is already installed:

##### If a mode has been selected previously:

- Boot straight into the active mode (Simple, Flight, or Swarm).
- If login enforcement is enabled, present the login screen.

#### If no mode has been selected yet:

- Display the `welcome.html` onboarding screen.

#### If Dragonfly is **not** installed:

- Boot into a full **Demo Experience**:
  - Fake data, in-memory only.
  - UI fully interactive.
  - Banner: *"Demo Mode: Dragonfly is not installed. This is a preview ‚Äî none of your hardware is touched."*
  - Option to run the installer (`dragonfly install`) via UI trigger or CLI.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Scenario C: Installation (`dragonfly install`)

#### If Dragonfly is already installed:

- Check that all system services are healthy.
- Validate floating IP is reachable and not conflicting.
  - If IP conflict is detected:
    - Offer user a chance to change it.
    - Reassign IP using `kube-vip` without disrupting the system.

#### If Dragonfly is **not** installed:

- Start the installation **immediately** *and* launch the **Install UI**.
- Smee is disabled during install to prevent interference.
- Install proceeds with the following steps:

##### üöÄ Installation Phases:

1. **Floating IP assignment**

   - Scans next 20 IPs above host's IP.
   - Claims first available address.

2. **Cluster setup**

   - Deploys `k3s` if not already running.
   - Waits for it to pass `livez` / `readyz` checks (or CoreDNS).
   - Grabs kubeconfig.

3. **Chart deployment**

   - Deploys modified Tinkerbell stack (Smee & Hook downloads disabled).
   - NGINX for Tinkerbell points to Dragonfly port 3000.
   - Deploys Dragonfly chart, which gives you a real live Dragonfly install on the floating IP selected earlier.

4. **Visual Feedback**

   - Shows live animated rocket UI with install phases via SSE.
   - Updates status messages for each step ("Installing k3s", "Deploying Tinkerbell", etc).

5. **Transition to main UI**

   - After install completes:
     - UI fades and rehydrates from the live server.
     - Seamless redirect to live Dragonfly instance.
     - As this is now a Scenario B system with no selected mode:
       - The Welcome screen is shown.
       - If an Xbox controller is connected:
         - Middle (Flight) card is focused and expands.
         - Pressing A activates Flight mode immediately.

---

### üöÄ Scenario D: Mode Selection (Simple, Flight, Swarm)

When the user selects a mode from the Welcome screen:

#### üü¢ Simple Mode:

- Deploy a lightweight DHCP helper daemon.
- This acts similarly to Smee, but without interfering with existing DHCP servers.
- Uses Dragonfly‚Äôs MAC-to-IPXE selector infrastructure.
- Can staple iPXE instructions onto existing DHCP replies.
- Slower but agentless ‚Äî great for legacy environments.

#### üü° Flight Mode:

- Deploy Smee in full automatic mode.
- Bootstrap all required OS templates immediately.
- PXE boots are automatically registered and provisioned.
- Designed for fast, hands-free cluster bring-up.

#### üîµ Swarm Mode:

- Does everything Flight Mode does.
- Also enables:
  - `k3s` bootstrap token creation
  - Auto-join scripts for new machines
  - UI changes:
    - "Convert to Dragonfly node" button appears on unjoined nodes.
    - Enables node-based clustering and self-healing behavior.

---

### Scenario E: Just Type

The "just type" feature allows users to simply click a text field within the UI and type.

- When the user clicks a text field, it activates the field so the user can immediately start typing.
- The field will be empty with the previous text shown in half opacity until the user starts typing.
- If the user types a new value and clicks away, the field will be ready to save upon pressing an Apply button that will replace the Reimage button on the Actions column for the machine.

#### Field Types
| Field Type | Field Editable? | Field Validation | On Change Result |
|------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| MAC Address | ‚ö†Ô∏è Yes (with confirm) | Regex for MAC (XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX) | Modal confirmation before saving |
| Hostname | ‚úÖ Yes | RFC-1123 / DNS-safe | Inline save, triggers Apply button |
| Friendly Name | ‚úÖ Yes | N/A | Read-only identity fingerprint, can be overridden |
| Tags | ‚úÖ Yes | Freeform or enum | Triggers Apply button |
| IP Address | ‚ö†Ô∏è Only when configured as a static IP | N/A | Offers to apply the new IP address on the next reimaging run |
| Status | ‚úÖ Yes | Basic state transitions are validated | Displays a tooltip with the new status and the impact the change will have, triggers Apply button

#### Example 1:
A user opens the machine list and sees a list of machines.

They click the MAC address field of a machine and type a new MAC address, but accidentally enter an invalid MAC format.

The field will show a tooltip with a suggested valid format and refuse to save the new address.

The user then corrects the MAC address and saves the new address.

Since the MAC address is usually not changed unless you're dealing with a VM, we pop up a modal to confirm the change.

"Changing the MAC address for this machine will cause issues if the machine is still using the old one. Definitely ready to change it?"

The user clicks "Yes" and the new address is saved.

#### Example 2

A user opens the machine list and sees a list of machines.

They click the hostname field of a machine and type a new hostname.

The field will accept any DNS-valid hostname. The user changes the hostname from

'jellyfin' to 'jellyfin01' and clicks save.

The "Reimage" button on the right changes to a calm deep blue "Apply" button.

Pressing "Apply" will change the hostname of that machine to 'jellyfin01' in future workflows and deployments. If the user clicks and holds Apply, a modal will appear asking if they want to apply the change straight away.

#### Example 3

A user opens the machine list and sees a list of machines.

They click the friendly name field of a machine and type a new friendly name.

The field will accept any friendly name. The user changes the friendly name from the BIP39-style

four word name (`CensusAbleQualityParent`) to `topaz-control-master`.

The friendly name will be saved and displayed in the machine list.

Changing their mind, the user quickly clicks the friendly name field again and clears the text.

The friendly name will be cleared and the original BIP39-style name will be shown again and saved.

### Scenario F: Reimaging machines

#### Example 1:
A user opens the machine list and sees a list of machines.

They select a different OS than the one currently installed on the machine.

The blue Apply button appears on the Actions column for the machine, replacing the Reimage button.

The user clicks Apply and a modal pops up confirming that the user wants to reimage the machine
to apply the new OS, warning at the loss of data.

The user clicks "Yes" and the machine is reimaged with the new OS.

#### Example 2:
A user opens the machine list and sees a list of machines.

They click the Reimage button for a machine.

A modal pops up confirming that the user wants to reimage the machine
to apply the new OS, warning at the loss of data.

The user clicks "Yes" and the machine is reimaged with the new OS.

### Summary

Dragonfly‚Äôs onboarding is structured to:

- Be beautiful and expressive from first contact
- Stay safe and read-only in Demo Mode
- Empower users with role selection
- Guide them gently but confidently into full automation

Whether they're starting from nothing or joining an existing stack ‚Äî
Dragonfly meets them exactly where they are, and takes them further.
